# Study Notebook: A/B Test

## Install

This notebook requires **Python 3.7.6** and the following Python libraries installed:

- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org)
- [scipy](https://www.scipy.org/)

You will also need to have software installed to run and execute a [Jupyter Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html)

If you do not have Python installed yet, it is highly recommended that you install the [Anaconda](http://continuum.io/downloads) distribution of Python, which already has the above packages and more included. Make sure that you select the Python 3.x installer.

## Run

In a terminal or command window, navigate to the top-level project directory `ab_tests-study_notebook/` (that contains this README) and run one of the following commands:

```bash
jupyter notebook ab_tests-study_notebook.ipynb
```
or
```bash
ipython notebook ab_tests-study_notebook.ipynb
```

This will open the Jupyter Notebook software and project file in your web browser.
